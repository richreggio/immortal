## About

Attempt at an idle/incremental game and learning a bit of Rust/WASM

Currently attempting to use the Yew framework. Goal is to be as portable as possible.

#### Requirements

- Must have "wasm32-unknown-unknown" target installed
- wasm builder such as trunk is also required to build the app

#### Goals

A MVP should have the following:

- Ticking/heartbeat system
- auto save
- spiritual cultivation flavor and mechanics (Mind attributes)
- vessel cultivation flavor and mechanics (Body attributes)
- settlement management
- Prestige system (Strength of soul? some kind of arbitrary counter?)
- CSS Styling/minimal graphics
